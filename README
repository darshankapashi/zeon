make all -j

It will create the binaries in the bin/ folder.

Run:
Leader - ./bin/leader
Server - ./bin/server --my_nid= --client_port= --server_port=

For a simpler startup, check the scripts/ folder. startup.sh reads from the config.txt and starts up the leader and the servers on localhost with the right arguments.

Configuration files:
config.txt - It contains 1 line per server in the System
metadata.txt - It contains different parameters of the system, to be used by the leader

Code Organization:
src/
  - client: Some client libraries/binaries to query the system
  - leader: Code for the Leader module
  - server: Code for the Server. Some of it is included by the leader/ directory too
  - if: All the thrift interfaces
