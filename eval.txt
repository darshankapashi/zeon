1. Increasing replicas does not increase creation time by a lot
10000 creates, 3 servers, 1 client
Replicas: +0 Time:  3689001
Replicas: +1 Time: 11304625
Replicas: +2 Time: 14736025

30000 creates, 3 servers, 3 clients
Replicas: +0 Time:  6418227
Replicas: +1 Time: 18369477
Replicas: +2 Time: 27464490

Use:
./bin/benchmark_client --create=1 --start_create=0 --end_create=10000
sh scripts/3clients.sh

2. 1 server, 3 clients vs 3 servers, 3 clients -> QPS is equivalent
3 servers, 1 clients, +1 replicas -> 10817380
3 servers, 2 clients, +1 replicas -> 14378073
3 servers, 3 clients, +1 replicas -> 18072242
3 servers, 4 clients, +1 replicas -> 21846114
3 servers, 5 clients, +1 replicas -> 25287483
30 clients -> 139595056

1 servers, 1 clients, +0 replicas ->  2793463
1 servers, 2 clients, +0 replicas ->  4160543
1 servers, 3 clients, +0 replicas ->  5752337
1 servers, 4 clients, +0 replicas ->  6447094
1 servers, 5 clients, +0 replicas ->  6454684
30 clients -> 53186413

Use:
sh scripts/3clients.sh 30

3. Run benchmark_client for t time period and load balance in between. Put more load on 1 rectangle
4.7s vs 3s

3 servers, +0 replicas, no call to adjoining server, 20 clients

Use:
sh scripts/startup.sh
sh scripts/3clients.sh 7
sh scripts/3clients.sh 20 20
